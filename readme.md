# 🧬 D3: A Compact Model for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction

Welcome to the **D3 Project** repository! 🚀 In this study, we developed **D3**, a Small Language Model (SLM) designed to predict **Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI)**. While larger models often hog the spotlight, our focus here is to strike a balance between **high performance** and **resource efficiency** — and to show that **smaller can be just as mighty**. 💪✨

## 🌟 Overview

**DDI prediction** plays a critical role in healthcare 🏥, especially as drug combinations become more common in treatment plans. Traditional methods for identifying DDIs can be **labor-intensive** and **error-prone**. To solve this, we pre-trained **D3**, a nimble small language model, using data compiled from **DrugBank** and compared it against state-of-the-art, fine-tuned **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, including:

- **Phi 1.5** 🔵
- **Gemma 2B** 💎
- **Mistral V0.2** 🌪️
- **LLaMA 3** 🦙✨

Despite being **1,000 times smaller** than LLaMA 3, **D3** managed to hold its ground by delivering **competitive results** in DDI prediction, confirmed through both **metrics** and **expert evaluations**. 📊👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️

## 🚀 Quickstart

Want to get started? Follow these simple steps to run **D3** and predict DDIs:

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/serag-ai/D3.git
   cd D3
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the **fine-tuning notebook** to explore D3's training process:  
   - Open `Unsloth_Finetuning.ipynb` and execute the cells in your environment to observe the fine-tuning procedure. 🧑‍💻📓
